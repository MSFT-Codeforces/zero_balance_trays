**Problem Statement**
Sakurako has an array that contains exactly `a` numbers equal to `1` and `b` numbers equal to `2`.

She must put either a `'+'` sign or a `'-'` sign in front of every element (each element is used exactly once). After that, all signed values are added together.

Determine for each test case whether it is possible to choose the signs so that the final sum equals `0`.

**Input Format**
- The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`) — the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `a` and `b` (`0 ≤ a, b < 10`) — the number of ones and the number of twos in the array.

**Output Format**
For each test case, print `"YES"` if it is possible to make the total sum equal to `0`, otherwise print `"NO"`.

Any letter case is accepted.

**Examples**
Input:
```
5
0 1
0 3
2 0
2 3
3 1
```

Output:
```
NO
NO
YES
YES
NO
```

**Editorial**
Putting signs is equivalent to splitting the multiset into two groups with equal sum:

Let `P` be the elements with `'+'` and `N` be the elements with `'-'`.
We need:
`sum(P) - sum(N) = 0`  ⇒  `sum(P) = sum(N)`.

So the total sum `S = a + 2b` must be even. Since `2b` is always even, this requires:
- `a` must be even, otherwise the answer is `"NO"`.

Now assume `a` is even. If `a = 0`, the array consists only of `2`s. To get sum `0`, the number of `+2` must equal the number of `-2`, which is possible only when:
- `b` is even.

If `a > 0` and `a` is even, the answer is always `"YES"`:
- If `b` is even, split the `2`s equally and also split the `1`s equally.
- If `b` is odd, after splitting the `2`s as evenly as possible, one side is larger by `2`; this can be fixed by moving two `1`s to the smaller side. Since `a` is even and positive, we have at least two `1`s available when needed.

So the final conditions are:
- If `a` is odd → `"NO"`.
- Else if `a = 0` and `b` is odd → `"NO"`.
- Otherwise → `"YES"`.

**Code**
```python
import sys

def solve() -> None:
    it = iter(sys.stdin.read().strip().split())
    t = int(next(it))
    out_lines = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(next(it))
        b = int(next(it))
        if a % 2 == 1:
            out_lines.append("NO")
        else:
            if a == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
                out_lines.append("NO")
            else:
                out_lines.append("YES")
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(out_lines))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
