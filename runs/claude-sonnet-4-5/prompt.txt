You are an expert competitive programmer. 
You will be provided with a problem statement, first analyze the problem, then provide your solution in Python. 
Consider edge cases, time complexity, and space complexity. 
Make sure your solution handles all constraints mentioned in the problem. 
Your final solution should be a complete, compilable Python program in a python codeblock.

**Zero Balance Trays**

You have a multiset of tiles containing exactly $a$ tiles of value $1$ and exactly $b$ tiles of value $2$.

For each query, you must place every tile into exactly one of two trays:

- **Sun tray** (adds to the sum)
- **Moon tray** (subtracts from the sum)

The net energy is defined as:

$$(\text{sum in Sun tray})-(\text{sum in Moon tray})$$

In the query, an integer $k$ is given: **exactly $k$ tiles must be placed into the Sun tray** (so the remaining $a+b-k$ tiles go to the Moon tray).

For each query, determine whether it is possible to make the net energy exactly $0$.

- If possible, output two integers $x$ and $y$:
  - $x$ = number of value-$1$ tiles placed into the Sun tray
  - $y$ = number of value-$2$ tiles placed into the Sun tray
- Otherwise output $-1$.

It is guaranteed that for fixed $(a,b,k)$, if a solution exists then the pair $(x,y)$ is unique.

**Input Format:-**

The first line contains an integer $t$ — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains:
- A line with three integers $a$, $b$, $q$.
- Then $q$ integers $k$ (possibly spanning multiple lines), one per query.

**Output Format:-**

For each query, print:
- $-1$ if it is impossible, or
- two integers $x$ and $y$ representing a valid distribution into the Sun tray.

**Constraints:-**

- $1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$
- $0 \le a,b \le 10^{18}$
- $1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- The sum of $q$ over all test cases is at most $2 \cdot 10^5$
- Each query integer $k$ fits in signed 64-bit (if $k \notin [0,a+b]$, it is impossible)

**Examples:-**
 - **Input:**
```

0 1 2 3 5

5 8 13
```

 - **Output:**
